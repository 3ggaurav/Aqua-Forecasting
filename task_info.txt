1.Aqua01.csv is the data file of field and aqua01.json is the info about the field.
2.Forecast data for next 7 days for field pH,DO ,water temperature .
3.you are free to use outside data example weather data from open source .
4.the result format(csv) will have next 7 days of pH,DO and water temperature and pond id and timestamp .(forecast for every one hour)
5.code using Jupyter or google colab , and have all plots saved .
5.use commnets to descibe about code and algorithm used for task.
